# Dummy Project

This was the quickest and easiest way to stop KoreBuild from breaking. It doesn't like when there **is** a `samples` directory but **none** of the projects have `project.json` files.

Since KoreBuild will soon be replaced by 'aspnet-build', I don't want to bother trying to fix it :)
